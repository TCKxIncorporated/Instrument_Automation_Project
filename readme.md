# Keithley 2230G Instrument Automation

A comprehensive, full‚Äëstack solution for remote control, configuration, and real‚Äëtime monitoring of the Keithley 2230G power supply. Harness the power of gRPC, FastAPI, and a modern web interface to streamline your laboratory workflows.

---

## Overview

This project delivers a robust pipeline for end‚Äëto‚Äëend instrument automation:

1. **gRPC Server**
   Wraps low‚Äëlevel PyVISA commands to discover, connect, and command instruments programmatically.
2. **FastAPI Bridge**
   Exposes intuitive REST endpoints that sit atop gRPC, enabling easy integration with scripts, dashboards, or other services.
3. **Interactive Frontend**
   A React‚Äëbased web UI built with Chart.js for seamless device selection, channel tuning, output control, and live voltage plotting.

**Core Workflow**

* Scan and list VISA‚Äëcompatible resources
* Connect to your Keithley 2230G by address
* Configure channel voltage, current, and safety limits
* Toggle channel outputs ON/OFF
* View real‚Äëtime voltage data over a rolling 5‚Äëminute window
* Clear and switch data streams when changing channels

---

## Key Features

* **Safe, Thread‚ÄëAware VISA Access**
  All PyVISA calls are serialized via threading locks to avoid race conditions.
* **Background Monitoring**
  Dedicated thread captures voltage readings every second and retains a 5‚Äëminute sliding window.
* **gRPC ‚Üî REST Integration**
  Flexible architecture lets you choose gRPC or HTTP for instrument control and data retrieval.
* **Dynamic Plotting**
  Interactive voltage charts that reset and redraw seamlessly when channels change.
* **Robust Error Handling**
  Clear messages and HTTP/gRPC status codes ensure visibility into failures.
* **Modular Codebase**
  Organized services, routes, and utilities for easy extension or reuse with other instruments.

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3.12** ‚Äî FastAPI, grpcio, pyvisa
* **gRPC** ‚Äî Protobuf definitions, synchronous and asynchronous service implementations
* **Frontend** ‚Äî React, Axios, Chart.js
* **Concurrency** ‚Äî Python threading for non‚Äëblocking background tasks
* **Deployment** ‚Äî Uvicorn server, optional Docker containerization

## Installation & Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instrument‚Äëautomation.git
   cd instrument‚Äëautomation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies & launch backend**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv            # Create virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate      # Activate (Linux/Mac)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python grpc_server.py         # Start gRPC on port 50051
   python -m main                # Start FastAPI on port 8000
   ```

3. **Launch the frontend**

   ```bash
   python -m main                   # React UI at http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Use the app**

   * Open `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:8000/docs` for API docs)
   * Browse devices, connect, configure channels, and watch live voltage curves.
